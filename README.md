## Game description

The game is based on the well-known game “Snake” with one important difference - the player plays for the bullseye and runs away from the snake.
Various bonuses appear on the map to help with this.

There are two game modes: **normal** and **endless**.

In the normal mode of the game you need to use stones to kill the snake and win, and in the endless mode you need to survive as much as possible
longer.
